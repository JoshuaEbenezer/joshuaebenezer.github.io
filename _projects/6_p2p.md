Studied the theoretical and practical aspects of peer-to-peer live streaming systems enhanced with recommender systems. The work involved deriving optimal peer load distributions and analyzing asymptotic behavior when recommenders suggest channel switching to improve viewing experience.

**Key Research Questions:**
- What is the optimal load distribution across P2P peers?
- How do recommender systems affect overall system stability?
- What are the asymptotic performance boundaries?

**Contributions:**
- Analytical framework for P2P system optimization
- Load distribution theory with recommender integration
- Asymptotic behavior characterization

**Relevance:**
P2P systems remain important for content delivery networks, and this analysis provides insights for designing scalable, recommendation-aware streaming systems.
