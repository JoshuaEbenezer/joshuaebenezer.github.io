**Project Supervisor:** Professor Jagath Rajapakse (Nanyang Technological University)

Developed an advanced pipeline for skin lesion segmentation combining novel image pre-processing, modified deep learning architecture, and post-processing techniques. The approach demonstrated **7% improvement** over baseline methods and achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy for identifying cancerous regions.

**Pipeline Components:**

1. **Pre-processing:** Custom image enhancement to improve lesion visibility
2. **Deep Learning:** Modified CNN architecture (Keras/TensorFlow backend)
3. **Post-processing:** Morphological operations to refine segmentation boundaries

**Results:** Significant improvement in melanoma detection accuracy, with practical applications in dermatological screening.
