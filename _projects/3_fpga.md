**Project Supervisor:** Professor Sudipta Mukhopadhyay (IIT Kharagpur)

Implemented and optimized a fog-removal algorithm on a Xilinx Zedboard FPGA, achieving **200 fps processing speed** for real-time video dehazing. The project involved designing the algorithm in synthesizable hardware description language and integrating system-level blocks.

**Technical Accomplishments:**
- **Framework:** Vivado HLS, Vivado IP Integrator
- **Target:** Xilinx Zedboard FPGA
- **Algorithm:** Anisotropic diffusion-based fog removal
- **Performance:** 200 fps in hardware simulations
- **Process:** Vivado HLS design → RTL synthesis → system-level integration

This implementation demonstrates the feasibility of real-time video enhancement on embedded hardware platforms, critical for mobile and autonomous systems applications.
