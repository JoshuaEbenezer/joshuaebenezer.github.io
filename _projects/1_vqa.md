Developed a novel no-reference video quality assessment (VQA) metric using space-time chips as the fundamental feature representation. This work led to multiple high-impact publications including **ChipQA** (published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2021) and extensions for HDR video quality assessment (**HDR-ChipQA**, 2023).

The space-time chips approach provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional frame-based features while capturing both spatial and temporal information relevant to video quality perception.
