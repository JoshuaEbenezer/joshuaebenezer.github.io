Conducted an extensive survey of combinatorial auctions, examining theoretical foundations, mechanisms, and practical applications in diverse domains including spectrum allocation, logistics, and e-commerce.

**Survey Scope:**
- Core theory of combinatorial auctions
- Mechanism design principles
- Computational complexity analysis
- Winner determination algorithms
- Practical applications and case studies

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Sealed-bid auctions
- Proxy bidding mechanisms
- Activity rules and information revelation
- Revenue properties
- Strategic behavior and equilibrium

**Applications:**
- FCC spectrum auctions
- Truck load auctions
- Airline slot allocation
- Ad exchange platforms
- Real estate transactions

Combinatorial auctions enable efficient allocation of bundles of items when there are interdependencies between items, making them valuable in many modern procurement and distribution scenarios.
